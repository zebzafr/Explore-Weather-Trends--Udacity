Local and Global Temperature Trends

### Summary
Analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

### Description
1. Extract the data from the database using SQL
2. Open the CSV file using spreadsheets or a software tool such as Python or R.
3. Create a visualization. Plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable.
2. Prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live.

### Submission
1. The final report needs to be in the form of a pdf document that includes an outline of steps taken to prepare the data to be visualized in the chart: tools used; how the calculations were performed; key considerations when deciding how to visualize the trends.
2. Line chart with local and global temperature trends.
3. At least four observations about the similarities and/or differences in the trends
